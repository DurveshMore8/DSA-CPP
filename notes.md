# DSA Notes

## Arrays
- Prefix sum helps in reducing time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n)
- Always consider edge cases: empty array, one element, negative numbers

## Strings
- Two-pointer technique is powerful for palindromes, substrings, etc.
- Watch out for null-termination in C++ strings vs char arrays

## Graphs
- Use BFS for shortest path (unweighted)
- DFS helps in cycle detection

## TODO
- [ ] Revise Time & Space Complexity
- [ ] Practice Sliding Window (10 problems)
- [ ] Learn STL: vector, map, set
